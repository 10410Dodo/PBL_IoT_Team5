### Project Name : Classroom Environment Monitoring and Improvementâ€“Using Arduino PM2.5 Air Quality Sensing Kit

### Motivation 
Many classroom environments lack effective air quality monitoring systems, especially in enclosed spaces with air conditioning, leading to prolonged exposure of students and teachers to poor air quality without timely detection. 
Even if there are air pollution sources present, the absence of effective alert mechanisms prevents the timely identification and response to air quality issues.
Therefore, it is crucial to address the inadequacies in air quality monitoring, the lack of alert mechanisms, and the need for environmental improvements to enhance the overall quality of the learning environment and safeguard the health and learning outcomes of students and teachers.

### Product Description 
The Arduino PM2.5 Air Quality Sensing Kit system combines IoT technology to enhance and improve the overall quality of the learning environment, ensuring that air quality issues are promptly detected and addressed.
The system uses an ESP-32 as the controller board, paired with the PMS5003T PM2.5 sensor, and DHT11, the temperature and humidity sensor. 
In addition to detecting particulate matter (PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10), it also provides temperature and humidity measurements, enhancing the overall quality of the learning environment's monitoring.
